# Hi, I'm IvÃ¡n ðŸ‘‹ðŸ’»

I'm a Full Stack Engineer with +8 years of experience and some crazy ideas about creating startups. 

These last 3 years I've been on the journey of creating a startup. As an entrepreneur I'm happy to have developed and tested several startup ideas, create MVP's from scratch, work with amazing people, help our customers, lead teams, learn from all this process and do marketing to make these ideas known. Valuable lessons all along the way.

Clean Code, DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, TDD, Microservices and Software Design Patterns.

Some technologies I enjoy working with include: Typescript, Vue, Nuxt.js, Node.js and Nest.js.

Most of my work is in private repositories, which belong to startup projects I founded. You can contact me through LinkedIn and I'd love to show you more about my work.
